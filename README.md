# Data science portfolio by Andrey Lukyanenko

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Classification problems.
### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
[Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).
This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.

### Otto Group Product Classification Challenge
[Otto Group Product Classification Challenge](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict their category. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge).
The data is obfuscated, so the main questionlies in the selection of the model for prediction.

## Regression problems.
### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

### Loan Prediction
[Loan Prediction](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Loan_Prediction.ipynb) is a knowledge and learning hackathon on Analyticsvidhya. Dream Housing Finance company deals in home loans. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. Based on customer's information we predict whether they should receive a loan or not. General description and data are available on [Analyticsvidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/).


### Caterpillar Tube Pricing
[Caterpillar Tube Pricing](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Caterpillar.ipynb) is a competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about tube assemblies we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/caterpillar-tube-pricing).
Dataset consists of many files, so there is an additional challenge in combining the data snd selecting the features.

## Natural language processing.
### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn
[Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

## Clustering
### Clustering with KMeans
Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. [Clustering with KMeans](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb) is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).

## Neural networks
### Feedforward neural network with regularization
[This](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb) is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

## Data exploration and analysis
### Telematic data
I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb). I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.
