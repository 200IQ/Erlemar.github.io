## Classification problems.
### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
[Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict types of them. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

### Otto Group Product Classification Challenge
[Otto Group Product Classification Challenge](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict to which category they belong. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge).

## Regression problems.
### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

### Caterpillar Tube Pricing
[Caterpillar Tube Pricing](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Caterpillar.ipynb) is a competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about tube assemblies we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/caterpillar-tube-pricing).


## Natural language processing.
### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn
[Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).

## Clustering
### Clustering with KMeans
Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. [Clustering with KMeans](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb) is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).
